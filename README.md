The Body Fat Calculator can be used to estimate your total body 
fat based on specific measurements.

What is body fat?

It is actually adipose tissue; its main function is to 
store energy in the form of lipids, but it cushions and 
insulates your body, too. Your body stores two types of fat:
 essential and storage body fat. The former is necessary to 
 support life and reproductive functions. Essential body fat
  is substantially higher for women because of childbearing 
  and hormonal functions. Storage body fat is the mass of
   additional accumulated fat. It does not mean that this type of body fat is unnecessary, though - part of it protects your abdomen and internal organs.

What measurements are required to get your body-fat prediction?

    1. Age
    2. Weight in pounds
    3. Height in cms
    4. Neck Circumference in cms
    5. Chest Circumference in cms
    6. Abdmomen Circumference in cms
    7. Hip Circumference in cms
    8. Thigh Circumference in cms
    9. Ankle Circumference in cms
    10. Bicepts Circumference in cms
    11. ForeArm  Circumference in cms
    12. Wrist Circumference in cms

## Based on Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value 
of a variable based on the value of another variable. 
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent 
variable. The variable you are using to predict the other 
variable's value is called the independent variable.

This data set can be used to illustrate multiple regression 
techniques. Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly 
and it is desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat 
that are not inconvenient/costly.
